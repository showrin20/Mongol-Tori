          <p class="Kilo">Enigma Systems is an IEEE RAS BRACU SBC-powered team. It is a team that participated in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kibo Robot Programming Challenge (JAXA). The Kibo Robot Programming Challenge is an educational initiative in which college and university students program free-flying robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball) in the International Space Station to solve various issues (ISS). KIBO is the International Space Station's Japanese experiment module. Inside the KIBO module, there is a robot named Astrobee. Teams would have to follow a series of instructions and program the Astrobee robot as exactly as possible in the second KIBO RPC, and the team that completed the mission with Astrobee as precisely as possible and in the shortest period would win. In KIBO RPC, there are three rounds of competition. ROS-based simulation software will be used in the first and second rounds of the preliminary round. Teams will be required to create a Java application that will be executed in a simulation that will be nearly identical to the real Astrobee race. In the final round, however, all finalists would solve the problem and have their software uplinked from Earth to the International Space Station, where it would be run on the Astrobee robot.</p>

        Bangladesh has a gem named Mizanul Chowdury who works at MIT and NASA in the United States, but JAXA did not include Bangladesh in the first KIBO RPC in 2020. He persuaded JAXA to include Bangladesh in the KIBO RPC's initial edition. Bangladesh could not be added because the competition had already begun. Bangladesh, on the other hand, has been added as a competition observer by JAXA. Enigma Systems, a team from BRAC University's IEEE RAS BRACU SBC, competed in the observer program and finished third. Bangladesh was included in the second KIBO RPC. Dr. Md. Khalilur Rhaman advised Enigma Systems. The "BRACU Scrutineers," a BRAC University squad, also competed in the competition. In total, 17 teams from Bangladesh entered the competition. Mizanul Chowdhury founded STEMX365, an educational institution dedicated to promoting knowledge and wisdom, alongside his daughter Saba Jamin Chowdhury. They enlisted the help of Bangladeshi teams, who were given the task of testing the code and simulation for themselves.

        

We, Enigma Systems constructed the program in accordance with JAXA's requirements. Because Astrobee runs on Android and Linux, we had to employ the Android development environment and Java programming language. We programmed Astrobee to read a QR code and extract information about the next point using some initial data provided by JAXA for the contests. After that, Astrobee is directed to autonomously detect 4 AR tags, read them, and use image processing to find the target location on which Astrobee will point a laser while avoiding 8 distinct random obstacle patterns. More points are earned by aiming the laser closer to the objective, avoiding more obstacles, reaching point B, and submitting mission completion notifications. The laser accuracy and time is taken to complete the task are elements in the scoring. The preliminary round was held on June 21, and Enigma System took first place among the Bangladeshi teams with 58 points. Following that, on July 18th, the second phase, the Programming Skills Round (PSR), was held with nine competing countries: Bangladesh, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, New Zealand, Malaysia, Japan, and Indonesia. Indentation Error (Thailand) won with 88.22 points, GeminiPYTW (Taiwan) came in second with 71.77 points, and Enigma Systems (Bangladesh) came in third with 59.28 points. The finalists improved their application in the final round to make it more capable so that when it is placed on Astrobee, it can handle real-world scenarios in space aboard the ISS. The only two teams to complete the task were Bangladesh's Enigma Systems and Thailand's Indentation Error.
